    <string name="aboutMessage">The goal of the game is to dodge the grenades. The player character
    (the smiley face) is controlled by touch/mouse input. Pressing down or clicking will begin the
    game, and colliding with a grenade or lifting the mouse/touch input will end it. A grenade will
    spawn every 5 seconds at the top left of the screen with a random velocity, and will remain
    bouncing around the screen until the game is over.</string>
