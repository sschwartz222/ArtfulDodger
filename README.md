# MobileSoftwareDevFinalGame

My final project for Mobile Software Development is a self-proposed game project titled Artful Dodger. 
The basic premise of the game is that the player object (represented by a smiley face) must avoid colliding with any of the increasing number of bouncing projectiles generated on the screen. The player must also not lift their finger (or mouse click if using an emulator) after starting the game. Score is based on the number of projectiles on the screen when defeat occurs, tracked by both a current score text and high score text.

##Goals

My initial proposal was as follows:
    
    >The game will be a simple one where the player needs to 1) keep their finger touching the screen at all times, and 2) dodge projectiles that continuously bounce  around the screen, with an additional projectile added every X seconds
    >Score will be based on how many seconds the player survives for

    >Learning goals for this project:

    >Track player touch input
    >Instantiate enemy objects (projectiles) that have properties like speed, direction, etc.
    >Objects move fluidly and are represented by sprites
    >Handle collision resolution between player and enemy object
    >Track and display high score (until app is uninstalled)
    
With the exception of the score mechanic changing from time to number of projectiles, I believe all of these criteria have been fulfilled
